        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Shrimp, bok choy, broccoli, and zucchini are happy together in a stir-fry that makes its own teriyaki sauce </p>
        <p> Serve over rice or noodles for a tasty meal. </p>

        <ul>
            <li>2 heads baby bok choy</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger root</li>
            <li>Â½ pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
            <li>1 cup broccoli florets</li>
            <li>1 cup sliced zucchini</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sweet vermouth</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons rice vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>

        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Slice the stem ends of the bok choy off to separate the leaves. Wash and drain the leaves; discard the ends. Cut the leafy green part of the leaves from the white part, keeping both parts separated.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet or wok over high heat; add oil. Cook and stir ginger in the hot oil for 1 minute. Add shrimp and continue cooking until they are bright pink and opaque, reducing heat as necessary to prevent burning, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir white pieces of bok choy, broccoli, zucchini, soy sauce, vermouth, brown sugar, and rice vinegar into the skillet. Cover and continue cooking until bok choy begins to soften, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir to coat the vegetables with the liquid. Sprinkle with cornstarch and stir until it mixes in and disappears. Top with the green pieces of bok choy, cover, and continue cooking until leaves start to wilt and the sauce thickens, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir to coat everything with sauce. Serve hot.</li>

        </ol>
